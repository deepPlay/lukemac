                        <h4>KPMG</h4>
                    <p>What the hell is Business Intelligence and Analytics? Stephen at the Sydney office was tasked with succinctly explaining what his new, verbosely named department was and what exactly they did in a presentation to thirty colleagues and partners. He had commissioned an artist to render an info-graphic depicting the department's role as a highway map, but it was still confusing.<br>We brainstormed a new metaphor: BIA as a tree and their outcomes as fruit. The final solution was an interactive image with multiple case studies, which was used during the presentation and made accessible to all employees via the office intranet.</p>

                    <p>The Iconic is a e-fashion start-up with rapid growth. Their head office is a gutted floor of a concrete building with four tarpaulins forming the photo studio. It is very much a trial-and-error project, which initially led to confusion amongst the fresh-faced customer service team.<br>I assisted Maree, a business analyst, in publishing five internal training documents and rolling out a new CRM system across the department.</p>

                    <p>Myfab.com sells furniture to the French. The furniture is made in China and the buyer never sees it before their purchase arrives by courier. But would you buy a chair without sitting on it first, <i>mon ami?</i><br>Buyers had to get excited about the product via the web site alone. I spoke with product managers and we created for each item a larger aesthetic, a personality, a story.</p>

                    <p>Sydney's PwC office is glittering tower overlooking Darling Harbour, a short walk from similarly megalithic firms Ernst and Young, KPMG, Macquarie Bank and CBA. How does such a company train its consultants to remain competitive in the face of such competition, especially when attempting to transfer such ineffable talents as leadership?<br>I designed a collection of 'tarot cards' for an internal leadership training program. Each card had a corporate value on one side and a related affirmation on the other.</p>
